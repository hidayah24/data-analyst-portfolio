# Market Prediction Competition

## Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for a machine learning competition focused on predicting market trends or stock prices. The goal is to build a predictive model using historical market data to forecast future outcomes, such as price movements or trading signals, and submit predictions for evaluation in the competition.

The project leverages data from a provided dataset and uses exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models to achieve high accuracy.

## Dataset

- **Train Data**: Located at `datasets/train.csv`. This file contains historical features (e.g., past prices, volumes, indicators) and target variables (e.g., future price directions or values).
- **Test Data**: Assumed to be in `datasets/test.csv` (not shown in the current notebook). Used for generating competition submissions.
- The dataset is loaded and explored in the main notebook `market_prediction.ipynb`.

## Project Structure

- `market_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data loading, EDA, model training, and prediction generation.
- `datasets/`: Directory containing the competition datasets (`train.csv`, `test.csv`).
- Other files (if added): Scripts for feature engineering, model evaluation, or submission preparation.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

Additional libraries may be required based on the modeling approach (e.g., XGBoost, TensorFlow for deep learning models).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place the dataset files in the `datasets/` directory.
3. Open and run `market_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   - Load and explore the data.
   - Perform EDA to understand patterns and correlations.
   - Train models (e.g., regression, classification, or time-series forecasting).
   - Generate predictions for the test set and prepare submission files.
4. For submission to the competition platform (e.g., Kaggle), export predictions in the required format (typically CSV).

## Approach

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions, check for missing values, and identify key features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create lagged features, technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), or handle time-series aspects.
- **Modeling**: Experiment with algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM for sequential data, or ensembles.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics such as MAE, RMSE for regression, or accuracy/F1 for classification, depending on the competition's scoring.
