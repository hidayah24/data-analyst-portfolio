Files:
train.csv Historic market data. The coverage stretches back decades; expect to see extensive missing values early on.

date_id - An identifier for a single trading day.
M* - Market Dynamics/Technical features.
E* - Macro Economic features.
I* - Interest Rate features.
P* - Price/Valuation features.
V* - Volatility features.
S* - Sentiment features.
MOM* - Momentum features.
D* - Dummy/Binary features.
forward_returns - The returns from buying the S&P 500 and selling it a day later. Train set only.
risk_free_rate - The federal funds rate. Train set only.
market_forward_excess_returns - Forward returns relative to expectations. Computed by subtracting the rolling five-year mean forward returns and winsorizing the result using a median absolute deviation (MAD) with a criterion of 4. Train set only.
test.csv A mock test set representing the structure of the unseen test set. The test set used for the public leaderboard set is a copy of the last 180 date IDs in the train set. As a result, the public leaderboard scores are not meaningful. The unseen copy of this file served by the evaluation API may be updated during the model training phase.

date_id
